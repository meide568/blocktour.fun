                <h2>About The Game</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Block Tour! This game is a captivating and challenging puzzle adventure inspired by classic "unblock me" style games, often known as Klotski or KFZ puzzles. The objective is simple: guide the main, uniquely marked block to the designated exit. However, the path is obstructed by other blocks that you must strategically slide out of the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenge your spatial reasoning and planning skills across numerous levels, each more intricate than the last. With its clean visuals and intuitive controls, Block Tour provides a pure puzzle-solving experience that is both relaxing and mentally stimulating.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>
                    The controls are straightforward, designed for both mouse and touch screens:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Click/Tap and Drag:</strong> Select any block and drag it horizontally or vertically into an empty space.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Clear a path to move the primary block (the one with the pattern) to the exit area on the right side of the board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategy is Key:</strong> Think several moves ahead! Sometimes you need to move blocks out of the way to make room for other blocks to move. The fewest moves wins!</li>
                </ul>
